BUG:Adding items in cart first attemp cause error 
adding items in second attemp working but first attemp not counted.

NOTE: test unit and any test process are void in the project 
the author understand the risk of a application without testing but since
the application is just for prototyping and practice author will leave that 
process "For now"
